# Image Classification with ResNet  

ðŸ”¬ **Patch-based Axonal Fiber Classification using ResNet50 for Whole-Brain Light Sheet Microscopy**  

## Overview  
This repository implements a **ResNet-based binary classification model** to determine whether an image patch contains **axonal fibers (Class 1)** or **not (Class 0)**. This model is part of a larger pipeline developed to **identify axonal fibers in whole-brain teravoxel-scale light sheet microscopy images**.  

## Task & Pipeline Integration  
- âœ… **Binary classification task**: Each image patch is labeled as:  
  - **Class 1** â†’ Contains axonal fiber  
  - **Class 0** â†’ No axonal fiber  
- âœ… **Model**: ResNet50 trained using PyTorch on microscopy image patches.  
- âœ… **Pipeline Integration**:  
  - The **inference script** generates a `metadata.json` file containing **patch names and classification outputs**.  
  - These predictions feed into the **next step of the pipeline** for whole-brain connectivity analysis.  

## Features  
- âœ… **ResNet-based classification from MONAI**: Supports pretrained and custom-trained models for patch-level classification.  
- âœ… **Efficient training pipeline**: Optimized for multi-GPU training and mixed precision.  
- âœ… **Inference with metrics**: Computes classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- âœ… **Configurable setup**: Uses `config.yml` for flexible hyperparameter tuning.  
- âœ… **Reusable utilities**: Modularized codebase for easily integrating cosine scheduler into other projects.
- âœ… **Visualization Training and Metric Curves**: This repository includes a plotting utility to visualize training performance similar to wandb.

ðŸš€ **Flexible Usage:** Although this model was developed for **axonal fiber classification**, it can be adapted for **other binary classification tasks** by providing a properly formatted dataset. The key requirement is a `data_dicts.pickle` file containing a **list of dictionaries**, where each dictionary includes:  
```python
{
    "image": "path/to/image1.tiff",
    "classification_label": 1  # or 0
}
```

## Training Performance  

I used a dataset of manually labeled patches: 
- 853  images as train dataset 
- 174  images as validation dataset 
- 177  images as test dataset

Each image has the size of 256x256x256 voxels

Below are the **training loss and evaluation metric curves**:  

**Hyperparameters:**
- downsample images to 64x64x64 voxels
- FB score (B=1) instead of F1 as the criterion to choose the best model as recall was more important than precision
- batch size of 64
- 5x more weights for class 1 in BCE loss function
